# Getting Started
I'm Tanny, or Tanner. Editor in Chief at Nudie Magazine, a print only promotional platform for queer and marginalized artists. We only printed 6 volumes but managed to place 3rd in the Collaboration category in the 2020 Broken Pencil Zine Awards. Please start here if you have not done so yet. This was written before I began developing myself. I don’t intend to be a developer in the project but wanted to learn the ins and outs of NFTs because my only exposure to crypto was Helium, a decentralized wireless project I got into in 2021.

Nudie Magazine was a way for me to leverage my privilege as a cis-male perceived white person. I came out as nonbinary in 2019 into what I thought was a world growing in understanding.. but have watched trans genocide taking place and am eager to amplify this message again.
</br></br>
We commissioned artists, printed magazines, and threw parties with free drinks, drag shows, live paintings, poetry, queer DJs, etc. We were trying to disseminate a political message with titties on it to encourage cis people into unpacking some things. My desire to generate wealth for my community is growing every day, watching… the things.. you know.

# SO NUDIE WEB3 
This is where I’m needing frens. Currently, there is no capital to put toward this project. It’ll be a labor of love til we can drum up a bit of support. I don’t want to get rich off this, but do I want it to support the folks involved, myself included. We want to build an ecosystem here, a tide rising all boats.
</br></br>
This is the message I’m preparing to post to instagram:
</br></br>
“Nudie Magazine is coming back and it’s going to be bigger and better than ever and if you were ever apart before please reach out because we’ve got something special for you. Nudie magazine is going web3!
</br></br>
Nudie Magazine is going to become a digital art gallery and NFT trading platform designed to elevate marginalized artists by creating an ecosystem that generates tangible wealth for sex workers, queer artists, and more. 
</br></br>
Rather than publishing a print only magazine, we will be minting private NFT collections and allowing viewers to participate in digital galleries by holding an NFT in their wallet that represents that specific gallery collection. Artists will be able to submit as they were before and accepted submissions will be rewarded with a NudieCoin. This SPL Token will be used to purchase gallery viewing NFT’s, and be the native token used to trade Nudie NFTs. Contributors will be able to set the quantity and floor price of their submissions and receive a specified royalty depending on the desire of the artist, these royalties can be split with up to four wallets to allow collaborations to receive royalties. We are excited to be developing this smutty ecosystem for queer, feminine and marginalized artists. “
</br></br>
It’s a bit cut and dry because none of my followers are crypto folks, twitter and insta are like 2 separate worlds in that way. There will be more to it. I want to provide staking as well.

# ROLES Required:
**-Fullstack dev:** A creative who can ground-up a real world project with little direction.</br>
**-Frontend dev:** An artist in front end development who can create memorable user experiences.</br>
**-Curator:** I’m currently the curator, but I want to delegate this role.</br>
**-Community/Discord/Twitter:** A Discord server mod who can lead online communities.</br>
**-DeFi dev:** Someone with an economic development background to lead tokenomics and security.</br>

The whole dream is mutable, and I want it to conform to needs of a community, which we unfortunately lost and will be building again from the ground up. We want to eventually replicate this metaverse stylee by working with drag queens and queer performers, burlesque dancers, etc. to create avatars, and throw Nudie Release parties in real life as well. We believe queer people belong on this earth, Black lives matter, trans lives matter, supporting trans youth matters, sex work is work, sex and body positivity matter, and that unfettered neo-colonial white supremacist corporate capitalism is the biggest existential threat we face on earth. LET'S MAKE SOME WAVES
